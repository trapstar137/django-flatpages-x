Django Flatpage Extensions
===============================
An extension to django.contrib.flatpages to provide for 
 
- Support markdown and other similar markup formats. You can also provide you own markup  format parser.
 
- Optional support for the excellent markTtUp jquery editor. This requires the installation django-markitup.
   
- Easy inclusion of images in flatpages. Note Admin image thumbnails require the installation  of sorl thumbnails.
   
- The inclusion of metatag keywords and descriptions in flatpages.
 
- Some support for revisions.

Migrating you data to flapages_x should not be difficult since the
data which currently in the contrib.Flatpage model (content, titles) is not affected. 
Your templates will still utilize the  *{{flatpage.content}}* and *{{flatpage.body}}* 
context variables.
Once you installed flatpages_x the markdown formatted content
is actually be stored separately in a related Revisions model. 
On saving, this will be rendered to html via the configurable markdown and saved to
the Flatpage.content field
